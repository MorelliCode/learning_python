#  This exercise is Part 1 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 2 and Part 3.

# In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary. Download this file and save it in the same directory as your Python code. This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments. Each line in the file contains a single word.

# Hint: use the Python random library for picking a random word.

import random
word_list = []

def import_list(file):
    #start by opening the file, reading each line while stripping it of newline and possible white spaces
    #Then return the list
    with open(file, "r") as file_list:
        line = file_list.readline().strip()
        lines = []
        while line:
            lines.append(line)
            line = file_list.readline().strip()
        return lines

def pick_word(word_list):
    chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)
    return chosen_word

word_list = import_list("30.txt")
print(pick_word(word_list))
