# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

number = int(input("Give me a number: \n"))
number_list = range(1, number + 1)

print("The possible divisors for this number are:")

for element in number_list:
    if number % element == 0:
        print(element)
